            This website aims to host example applications for the various models that I have crafted. Therefore this only shows the frontend of the product.
            Albeit if you're interested in the backend to these applications, I have linked my Github Repo, alongside my LinkedIn profile, on the navigation bar above.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for reading this, and please refer to the right navigation bar for the various model applications!
